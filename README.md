# Detect-Driving-Behavior
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect and classify driving behaviors from images or video frames. The model takes input images and predicts whether the driver is exhibiting safe or risky driving behavior.

Try it out via Google Colab and post it on GitHub later.

This project was conducted during the 3rd semester of the 2st year of study at King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok.
